	<h1> Important notice </h1>
	<p>

On <strong>Sunday January 9th 2010</strong>, a gang of goths were spotted stealing several garden gnomes from a shopping center in downtown <strong>Milwaukee</strong>. They were all wearing <strong>green <em>jumpsuits and silly hats</em></strong>, and seemed to be having a whale of a time. If anyone has any information about this incident, please contact the police <strong>now</strong>.
